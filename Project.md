Project Title: Multi-city Hotel Chain Management System

Description:

This SQL project involves designing and implementing a relational database for a multi-city hotel chain. The system manages hotel information, room availability, guest bookings, employee details, and customer feedback. It reflects the real-world operational needs of a hospitality business with multiple hotel branches across different cities.

Key Components and Features:

Entities and Schema Design:

Hotel: Stores hotel details including a unique hotel code, name, city, and star rating.

Room: Each room is linked to a hotel and includes type, price per night, room number, and availability status.

Guest: Contains guest ID, name, and loyalty level.

Booking: Manages room bookings with guest ID, room ID, check-in and check-out dates, and total bill.

Feedback: Captures customer feedback and ratings associated with specific bookings.

Employee: Stores employee details like name, role, shift, and the hotel they are assigned to.

HotelManager: Associates a hotel with its manager, who is also an employee.

Real-World Relationships:

Each hotel can have multiple rooms and employees.

Rooms are booked by guests and can have different availability statuses.

Guests can make multiple bookings and provide feedback for each.

Employee records include roles such as receptionist, housekeeping, and manager with shift timings.

Hotel managers are explicitly linked to hotels for administrative clarity.

Data Population:

Sample hotels like Grand Palace in Hyderabad and Ocean View in Chennai.

Room types like Deluxe, Standard, and Suite with price and availability.

Guests such as Ravi Kumar and Sneha Reddy with loyalty levels like Gold and Silver.

Bookings include real check-in/out dates and bills.

Feedback shows actual user ratings and comments.

Employees are listed with designated roles and shifts.

Managers are identified and linked to their respective hotels.

Conclusion:

This project demonstrates a robust, normalized database structure suitable for managing operations of a hotel chain. It supports tracking guest activities, room status, employee roles, and customer satisfaction through feedback. The schema reflects practical hotel management scenarios and is scalable for real-world use.
